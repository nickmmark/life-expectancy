# life-expectancy

Exploring the wide geographic variation in life expectancy in the US.

One of the most striking things about life expectancy in the US, is how much it varies depending on where you live.
Someone born today in Hawaii could expect to live to be 81. On the other hand, someone born in Mississippi would live to be just 72 on average.
9 years is a big difference between states.

In most developed countries the difference is much smaller. For example in Japan, The difference between prefectures is just 2 years; 84 vs 82.
In the UK, the difference in LE by regions was about 3 years: about 77 in scotland and 80 in england.

If we imagine that each US state as a country we can compare them to world. 
Hawaii - with a life-expectancy of 82.3 years in 2019 - would be in 12th place worldwide, in between Spain and Sweden.
On the other hand, West Virginia - with a life expectancy of 74.8 years - would be 77th place, just ahead of Columbia and behind Iran.
It's even worse if we look at more recent data: In 2020, The life expectancy in Mississippi fell to 71.9. That would put Mississippi in 127th place worldwide, between Kyrgyzstan (71.95) & Tajikistan (71.76)
